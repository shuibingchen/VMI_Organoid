# Vascularized Macrophage-Islet Organoids to Model Immune-Mediated Pancreatic Î² cell Pyroptosis upon Viral Infection

This repository contains the R scripts necessary to perform the analysis in our
manuscript *Liuliu Yang et al.* "Vascularized Macrophage-Islet Organoids to Model
Immune-Mediated Pancreatic $\beta$ cell Pyroptosis upon Viral Infection.", as described in the supplementary
methods and main text.

### Input Data

The single cell RNA-seq and single cell ATAC-seq data were generated with the 10X kit and pre-processed
using the 10X cellranger pipeline. The raw data are available in the GEO
database with accession#
[GSEXXXXX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?&acc=GSE207352).

### Requirements

The following R packages were used:
